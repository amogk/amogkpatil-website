                <h1>about me</h1>
                <p>Besides all of my hobbies that you read about on the home page, I would define myself as a curious and perseverant person. My curiosity drives me to explore new ideas and continuously learn. Coupled with my perseverance, this combination enables me to tackle challenges and achieve my goals with determination and resilience. This website is centered around the projects I have created in the pursuit of my various hobbies such as robotics, 3D modelling, video editing and more along with my various roles and awards. I focus on these projects to showcase all the effort I have put in that isn't quantifiable.</p>
