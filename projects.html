                    <h1>Austin Heat Data Visualization in VR</h1>
                    <p>I am currently working on visualizing heat data in Austin through VR Platforms with the team at the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT Austin. The project involves porting heat and geographical data from the ArcGIS platform into manipulable data in Unity which can be experienced through VR platforms such as the Meta Quest 2. The goal of this project is to bring awareness regarding the devastating effects extreme natural behavior can have on people by providing an accessible means of experiencing it in VR.

                    <h1>FRC Robotics Shooter Mechanism Design</h1>
                    <p>This is an image of the design of our shooter mechanism for FRC team 2687 during the 2024 contest season titled "CRESCENDO." The mechanism was designed to shoot foam rings 14 inches in diameter a distance of roughly 15 feet. The mechanism took just over a month to fully prototype and test for use in-contes. However, continual updates and changes of materials used happened in between tournaments.

        <h3 id="generic_seconday_desc">Blender is a 3D modelling application that is typically used to produce animations, renders and 3D models in games, websites, apps and more. In fact, the 3D models you saw on the home page were made in Blender. I started learning how to use Blender because I was interested in video games at the time and was keen on learning everything I needed to know to be able to build one myself.</h3>
